# Mini-rest

A configurable looping timer

## Motivation

I had a need for a simple and non-intrusive timer that looped infinitely

[From the Huberman Lab newsletter](https://hubermanlab.com/teach-and-learn-better-with-a-neuroplasticity-super-protocol/)
> "...if we pause every so often for 10seconds and do nothing during the pause, neurons in the hippocampus and cortex—areas of the brain involved in learning and memory, engage the same patterns of neural activity that occurred during the actual activity of reading, musical practice, skill training, etc. but 10X faster—meaning you get 10X neural repetitions completed during the pause"

> The takeaway: randomly introduce 10 second pauses during learning
